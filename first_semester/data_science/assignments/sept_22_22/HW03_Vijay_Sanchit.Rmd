## Question 1. Import
**Read in the file with all the baseball players height, weight and age info (BaseballHeightWeight.csv) as a dataframe and save it as baseball. Then display the structure of the dataframe.**  

```{r Q1}
# This is coder's comments
# Since my RMD and csv files are in the same working directory, I do not need to give the full path to the csv file. Alternatively, you can use the functions getwd() and setwd() to handle it.

baseball <- data.frame(read.csv("BaseballHeightWeight.csv"))
# baseballdf <- read.csv("BaseballHeightWeight.csv")
# You can compare the two above lines, and look at the object called baseball in the "Environment" on the upper right. 
# Turns out either method gives the same result. In some cases (depending on the .csv file), they might differ. To be safe, I usually use data.frame( ) afterwards.
```

The function `read.csv()` was used to load the dataframe. In addition, we can see that there are `r nrow(baseball)` in the dataframe. 
Note that `read.csv()` is just one of the many functions you can use to import data files. 

The structure is printed below:

```{r, result="asis"}
# need results="asis" to overwrite the default, and show the result block in Html/pdf
str(baseball)
```

I have yet to find a simple and easy way to "pretty-print" such structure in R output. Most of the time we don't need to show these to the readers though. 


## Question 2. Head and Tail
**Print out the first 5 and the last 3 rows of the dataframe.**  

The `head()` and `tail()` functions are what we need.

```{r, results='markup'}
head(baseball, n=5)
tail(baseball, n=3)
```

But we should use the modified version in `ezids` from now on:

```{r, results="asis"}
# you can use "markup" or "asis" here to get the same result.
xkabledplyhead(baseball, 5, "The first 5 rows using `xkabledplyhead` function." )
```
and the last three rows:
```{r, results="asis"}
# you can use "markup" or "asis" here to get the same result.
xkabledplytail(baseball, 3, "The last 3 rows using `xkabledplytail` function." )
```


## Question 3. Header change
**Change the headers/column names from Weight.pounds. to weight, from Height.inches. to height, and Age to age.**  
```{r, results="asis"}
colnames(baseball)[4] <- "height"
colnames(baseball)[5] <- "weight"
colnames(baseball)[6] <- "age"
```

## Question 4. Head again
**Print out the first two lines again to see the new column names.**  
```{r}
xkabledplyhead(baseball, 5)
```


## Question 5. Summary
**Find the statistics (summary) of the heights, weights, and ages of the players. Using complete sentences, give the reader these summary.**  
```{r, results="asis"}
print("Statistics of height of players")
summary(baseball$height)
print("Statistics of weight of players")
summary(baseball$weight)
print("Statistics of age of players")
summary(baseball$age)
```


## Question 6. Subset
**You should find an issue with the weight data with an NA value. Use the `subset( )` function, select that data point (save as shyboy) and find out who the shy boy was.**
```{r, results="asis"}
shyboy <- subset(baseball, is.na(baseball$weight))
shyboy
cat("Shy boy is ", shyboy$Name)
```


## Question 7. Remove Shyboy
**Remove shyboy from baseball, and then show the number of observations of the cleaned up dataframe baseball.**  
```{r}
df_new <- subset(baseball, Name != "Kirk_Saarloos")
cat("Number of observations in new dataframe: ", nrow(df_new))
```


## Question 8. Boxplot
**Make a quick boxplot of the weight of the players. Use the `title( )` function immediately to add a title to the chart. (Try color #0000FF for blue.)**  
```{r, results="asis"}
boxplot(df_new$weight, ylab="weight (in lbs.)", col="#0000FF")
title("Boxplot of the weight of the players")
```

## Question 9. Histogram
**Make a histogram of the weight of the players. Try color 'green' this time. The function understands the word 'green' just fine. Give it a better title than the default. Does the distribution looks normal?**
```{r, results="asis"}
hist(df_new$weight, col="green", main = "Histogram of the weight of the players", xlab = "weight (in lbs.)")
cat("Distribution is not normal, it is right-skewed.")
```


## Question 10. Scatterplot
**Use ggplot, make a plot with weights vs heights of the players, color by Teams. Give it an appropriate title.**  
```{r, results="asis"}
library(ggplot2)
ggplot(df_new, aes(x=weight, y=height, color=Team)) +
  geom_point() +
  labs(x="weight (in lbs.)", y="height (in inches)") +
  labs(title = "Weight vs. Height point plot corresponding to teams")
```


## Question 11. Plot by age
**Make a plot with weights vs heights of the players, color by age.**
```{r, results="asis"}
ggplot(df_new, aes(x=weight, y=height)) +
  geom_point(aes(color=age)) +
  labs(x="weight (in lbs.)", y="height (in inches)") +
  labs(title = "Weight vs. Height point plot corresponding to age")
```


## Question 12. Team Washington
**Obtain a subset of the data with only Team Washington. Using complete sentences, give the number of players in Team Washington.**
```{r, results="asis"}
df_wash <- subset(df_new, Team=="WAS")
cat("Number of players in Team Washington is: ",nrow(df_wash))
```



## Question 13. Old Team Washington
**Obtain another subset with Team Washington and only players older than 28. How many are there in this veteran group?**
```{r, results="asis"}
df_age_older28 <- subset(df_wash, age>28)
cat("Players with age above 28: ",nrow(df_age_older28))
```
