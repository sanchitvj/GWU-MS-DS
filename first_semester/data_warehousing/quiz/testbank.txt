In a file approach to data management, the data definitions are included in each application separately.	incorrect	
In a file approach to data management, different applications could be using older and newer versions of the same data.	incorrect	
In a file approach to data management, a change in the structure of a data file is easily handled because each application has its own data files.	correct	
MC	
Which statement is NOT CORRECT?	
In a database approach, applications don't have their own files, but all applications access the same version of the data by interfacing with the DBMS.	incorrect	
In a database approach, the data definitions or metadata are stored in the applications accessing the data.	correct	
In a database approach, there is typically less storage needed compared to the file approach.	incorrect	
In a database approach, maintenance of data and metadata is easier.	incorrect	
MC	
Which statement is NOT CORRECT?	
In a file-based approach, every application had its own query and access procedures, even if they wanted to access the same data.	incorrect	
SQL is a database language to manage DBMSs without having to write a substantial amount of programming code.	incorrect	
SQL is a database language that focusses on how to access and retrieve the data.	correct	
SQL is a database language that allows different applications to access different subsets of the data necessary for each application.	incorrect

Which statement is NOT CORRECT?	
In a conceptual data model, the data requirements from the business should be captured and modeled.	incorrect	
A conceptual data model is implementation dependent.	correct	
A logical data model translates the conceptual data model to a specific implementation environment.	incorrect

No independence, they are basically the same thing	incorrect	
The internal layer	incorrect	
MC	
Statement A: The middle layer of the three-layer architecture consists of both the conceptual data model and the logical data model. The logical data model is physically implemented in the internal layer. <br><br> Statement B: The top level of the three-layer architecture is the external layer. Views for one or more applications always offer a window on the complete logical model.<br><br>Which sentence(s) is/are right?	
Only sentence A is right	correct	
Only sentence B is right	incorrect	
Sentence A and B are right	incorrect	
Neither A or B is right	incorrect

Statement A: DDL is the language used to define the logical data model, but no other data models. <br><br> Statement B: SQL is a DML language to retrieve, insert, delete and modify data. It is stored in the catalog. <br><br>Which sentence(s) is/are right?	Only A	incorrect	Only B	incorrect	A and B	incorrect	Neither A or B	correct	
MC	
Statement A: Physical data independence implies that neither the applications, nor the views or logical data models must be changed when changes are made to the data storage specifications in the internal data model. <br><br> Statement B: Logical data independence implies that software applications are minimally affected by changes in the conceptual or logical data model. <br><br>Which sentence(s) is/are right?	Only A	incorrect	Only B	incorrect	A and B	correct	Neither A or B	incorrect
