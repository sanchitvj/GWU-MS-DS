## My dear data project

I downloaded my most played songs on Spotify for 2022 using the [exportify](https://watsonbox.github.io/exportify/) app, which defaults to a .csv file. I then read it into R and cleaned up the variable names.

```{r read-data}
library(tidyverse)
library(janitor)

# read in songs file
my_songs <- readr::read_csv("your_top_songs_2022.csv")

# clean up variable names
my_songs <- janitor::clean_names(my_songs)
```

I then made a table of the most commonly played artists.

```{r make-table}
# make a table of most common artists
my_songs|>
  group_by(artist_name_s)|>
  summarize(Freq=n())|>
  arrange(desc(Freq))|>
  print(n = 20)
```




I then took that table and drew by hand this simple bar chart:

Neither handwriting nor art were strong points for me in school.
